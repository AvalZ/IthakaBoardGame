Each project should have place where to host. We will use Github, because it is the most popular repository at the moment.

---

After repository creation Eclipse Android project should be created.

---

Eclipse project should be filled with the information from the Github repository.  We will do this by cloning the Github project in different directory than the directory created by Eclipse wizard. After that we will merge both directories.

---

After directories merge initial Git commit should be done. This time it is possible to be done inside Eclipse.
